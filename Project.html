				<h2>More about me</h2>
				<details><summary>My Childhood</summary><p>I was born in the small town of Karukachal in Kerala, a south Indian state. My dad worked in the bank. So he used to get transferred to many places in South India once every 4 or 5 years. Thus I got the chance to study in 5 different schools. This allowed me to meet a lot of people of different cultures and lifestyles. I  made a lot of friends too. It also allowed me to get to know much new technology and I think living in Bangalore contributed the most to my growing interest in technology.</p></details>
